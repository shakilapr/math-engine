MathEngine - the math tutor you never asked for 

make a complete math engine, use all the available math python libraries, use conda and make an environment for it.. 

features:
1. user can either copy paste latex, or text. llm is used to understand the problem and convert it into a python code that can be executed by the math engine. 
user can also copy paste an image, so we need to make a python script to covert image to latex, and then use llm to understand the problem and convert it into a python code that can be executed by the math engine. 
2. math is not solved by llm, but by python code. llm is only used to understand the problem and convert it into a python code that can be executed by the math engine. 
3. this is to help student understand the problem and the solution, so we need to make a python script to explain the solution in a way that a student can understand. and include all the steps. instead of getting final answer only, we also get final answer, but we also get the steps to reach the final answer. each step is also calculated using python code. and each step is also explained in a way that a student can understand. and each step is also converted to latex. 
4. there needs a web ui with react, bun, tailwindcss, and shadcn ui. it should support latex, and clean and minimlaist. all the steps and explanations should be displayed in a way that a student can understand. 
6. visualization python scripts should be also run and the images should be displayed in the web ui. 
7. answers need to be cross checked with multiple python libraries to ensure accuracy. at least 3 python libraries should be used to cross check the answer.  
8. llms will only be used to generate proper explanations, and not the steps. llms will be used to generate python code to solve the problem, and then the python code will be executed by the math engine. 
9. math engine has a library of python scripts for different problems, and it should be able to generate python code for different problems. and it also have a index, so it can quickly find the python script for the problem. 
10. it also have a advanced feature, that allow to add pdf files of research papers. when added, it extract it extract the math parts from the pdf, do the calculations, and explain making it easy to understand math rich papers. 
11. the research paper thing should happen in a different page, so it breaks the complete research paper, use have search and replace feature [like the edit feature in openclaw] to edit one large expanded math paper with all the steps and explanations. 
12. input box, output box, and a chat box for conversation with the llm to understand the problem and the solution. 
13. can be able to add any kind of api key for llm, and it should be able to use it. [gemini, claude, deepseek, etc]
14. must support all the types of math problems, not simple college level ones. [calculas, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, statistics, probability, linear algebra, differential equations, etc]
15. equations and inputs should be editable.
