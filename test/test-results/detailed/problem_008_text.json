The p-value tells us the probability of obtaining results at least as extreme as the ones we observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true. The significance level (α) is the threshold we set for deciding when to reject the null hypothesis. If the p-value is less than or equal to α, it means the observed data is unlikely under the null hypothesis, so we have evidence against it. Here, we check if 0.00778 ≤ 0.05, which is true.",

In the context of ANOVA, the null hypothesis (H₀) states that all group means are equal (i.e., no significant difference among the groups). Rejecting H₀ means we have sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that at least one group mean is different from the others. This conclusion is made at the 5% significance level, meaning there's only a 5% chance of making such a conclusion if the null hypothesis were actually true (Type I error risk).",
