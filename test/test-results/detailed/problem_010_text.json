The significance level (α) is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it's actually true. A smaller α means we're being more strict about avoiding false rejections. In the F-test used in ANOVA, the critical value is the threshold we compare our test statistic to. When α decreases (like going from 5% to 1%), we need stronger evidence to reject H₀, so the critical value becomes larger. Think of it as raising the bar for rejection.",
